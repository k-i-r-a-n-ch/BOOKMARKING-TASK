        While the first-generation Fortuner was developed in Thailand by Thai and Japanese engineers, its facelifted version, as well as the Hilux and Innova, was designed in Australia by Toyota Australia, which is also responsible for developing the second-generation model.[2]

        For the medium body-on-frame SUV segment, Toyota offers the Hilux Surf/4Runner (Japan/North America) and the Land Cruiser Prado (Europe and Australasia). However, in some Central and South American countries and New Zealand, Toyota offers the Fortuner alongside the 4Runner and/or Prado, like in Peru, Panama, Ecuador, Colombia, El Salvador and Guatemala.
        
        Specialised variants with a naturally-aspirated 5L-E diesel engine is offered to governments, organisations and the UN alongside other utility vehicles such as the Prado, Hilux, HiAce, and the 70 and 200 series Land Cruisers.[3

        The Ford Everest is a mid-size SUV produced by Ford Motor Company since 2003. Developed and destined mainly for the Asia-Pacific region with production centered in Thailand, the first-generation Everest is based on the Mazda-based Ford Ranger pickup truck, while the following generations are based on the globally-marketed T6 Ranger. Unlike the Ranger which was paralleled with the Mazda B series or BT-50 until 2020, the Everest has no Mazda equivalent, as it was seen as unfitting for the brand.[1]

In India, the Everest was marketed as the Ford Endeavour in the Indian market to avoid legal issues due to the existence of a spice-making brand with the same name in the country.[2]

        The Hyundai Accent (Korean: 현대 엑센트), or Hyundai Verna (현대 베르나) is a subcompact car produced by Hyundai. In Australia, the first generation models carried over the Hyundai Excel name used by the Accent's predecessor. The Accent was replaced in 2000 by the Hyundai Verna in South Korea, although most international markets, including the US, retained the "Accent" name. The "Accent" name is an abbreviation of Advanced Compact Car of Epoch-making New Technology.[1]

The Accent is produced for the Chinese market by Beijing Hyundai Co., a joint venture with Beijing Automotive Industry Corp. For the Russian market it was assembled by the TagAZ plant in Taganrog until 2011, and since 2011 it was assembled by the HMMR plant in Saint Petersburg and sold under the new name Hyundai Solaris. In Mexico, the Accent was marketed until 2014 by Chrysler as the Dodge Attitude, previously known as the Verna by Dodge. In Venezuela, Chrysler marketed these models as the Dodge Brisa until 2006. The Brisa was assembled by Mitsubishi Motors at its plant in Barcelona, Venezuela. Since 2002, the Accent had been the longest-running small family car sold in North America. In Puerto Rico, the second and third generations were sold as the Hyundai Brio.
